# Command Line History

## July 13, 2025

The project was created with a pre-release version of the Phoenix project template. To install that we used:

```bash
mix archive.install hex phx_new 1.8.0-rc.3
```

When creating the project we wanted UUID-based id values and utilized the `--binary-id` [option](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.New.html#module-options).

```bash
mix phx.new --binary-id wayfinder
```
